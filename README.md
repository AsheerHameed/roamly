# Travel Planning and Exploration Platform

The Travel Planning and Exploration Platform is a comprehensive web application that empowers users to plan their trips and discover new destinations seamlessly. Leveraging the power of the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack and integrating with various free third-party APIs, this platform offers a seamless and personalized travel experience.

## Description
Users can search for destinations based on location, keywords, or categories, and explore detailed information about points of interest, attractions, and destination details. The app allows users to create personalized trip itineraries by selecting destinations, adding activities, and organizing their travel plans. Real-time weather forecasts and historical weather data are provided to help users plan their trips accordingly.
The platform also offers features like interactive maps, distance calculations, suggested routes, and estimated travel times between destinations. Users can create profiles, save their travel plans and preferences, and receive personalized destination recommendations based on their interests and travel styles.
With social sharing and community features, users can share their travel experiences, connect with other travelers, and access valuable insights from fellow explorers. The app also includes an administrative dashboard for managing user accounts, moderating user-generated content, and monitoring platform usage and analytics.
